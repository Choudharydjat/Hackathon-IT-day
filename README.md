We have developed an interactive site which deals with the problems that a farmer faces while buying the equipments.
We made it easy for them to find the equipments/machinery at an effective price short listed by our team.
Its easy to use. The user has to first make his/her account to login and will be redirected to the home page.
The home page contains of various equipments/machinery and it also shows what is recommended by farming experts and the best price for the following item.
User can also customize thier orders based on the quantity and we even provide additional discount on bulk orders to help them afford it.

There are couple of sections in our website based on users need.
It consists of Home, About Us, Feedback, e.t.c.,
It consists of one more page related to customized solution for non residence farmers facing issue for farming in the absence of thier presence at the following piece of land.
We provide well experienced farmer/workers to non resident peoples who want thier lands to be managed at thier absence due to any reasons. The workers.farmers are licensed and have proper knowledge about the fields.

We can take and evaluate customers feedback based on thier order to make improvements in our services.
One can even file complain or any issue related to our services in contact us section by directly mailing it to us.

There is also a review section to look upon for any new user to get the basic idea of the quality of our products and if the product meets thier requirement or not.

One can add any item to thier whislist or cart for them to buy it later.

We are still working on this project on daily basis to make improvements and get the result we want that is to satisfy all the needs for farmers and customers needing help with farming.
